### Introduction
This project is the frontend application for mobile app. This application is built using React and incorporates several libraries and packages to streamline the development process and enhance the application's capabilities.

### Technologies
The Fight Club frontend application uses the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Apollo Client**: A comprehensive library for performing GraphQL operations in React applications.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides a collection of components and styles based on Google's Material Design.
- **Chart.js**: A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data.
- **Styled-components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals.

### Installation
To get started with the Fight Club frontend application, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Run the following command in the project directory:
```
npm install
```

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm eject`: This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### Development Dependencies
Development dependencies include TypeScript type definitions for several libraries:
- **classnames**: A simple utility for conditionally joining class names together.
- **react-router-dom**: The core library for routing in React applications.
- **styled-components**: A library for styling React components.

### Performance Monitoring
The application uses the `web-vitals` library to measure and monitor the performance of the application in the real world.

### Contributing
Contributions to the Fight Club frontend application are welcome. Please make sure to test your code thoroughly and adhere to the coding standards and guidelines provided by the technologies used in this project.
